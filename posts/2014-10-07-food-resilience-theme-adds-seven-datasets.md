*   [Germplasm Resources Information Network](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/germplasm-resources-information-network-grin)
*   [Farm Program Atlas](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/farm-program-atlas)
*   [Climate Prediction Center (CPC) U.S. Seasonal Drought Outlook (SDO)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/climate-prediction-center-cpcu-s-seasonal-drought-outlook-sdo)
*   [2012 Census of Agriculture](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/2012-census-of-agriculture)
*   [World Agricultural Production](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/world-agricultural-production)
*   [National Animal Health Monitoring System (NAHMS)](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/national-animal-health-monitoring-system)
