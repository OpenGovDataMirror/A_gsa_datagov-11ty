title: Open Data Executive Order Shows Path Forward
---

Today, the White House is issuing a new Executive Order on [Open Data](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-)– one that is significantly different from the open data policies that have come before it — reflecting Sunlight’s [persistent call](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tzv4dGic7CKXeUBuSiPBSXWpDiLhQhdC9kaq8L8WxKY/edit?usp=sharing) for stronger public listings of agency data, and demonstrating a new path forward for governments committing to open data.

This Executive Order and the [new policies](http://www.whitehouse.gov) that accompany it cover a lot of ground, building public reporting systems, adding new goals, creating new avenues for [public participation](http://project-open-data.github.io/), and laying out new principles for openness, much of which can be found in Sunlight’s extensive [Open Data Policy Guidelines](http://sunlightfoundation.com/policy/opendata/), and the work of our [friends and allies](http://razor.occams.info/pubdocs/opendataciviccapital.html#format).
