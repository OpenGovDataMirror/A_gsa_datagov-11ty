This week marks the [one-year anniversary](http://www.whitehouse.gov/blog/2013/05/23/digital-strategy-delivering-better-results-public) of the Digital Government Strategy, and we want to take a moment to reflect on a recent White House [Executive Order](http://www.whitehouse.gov/the-press-office/2013/05/09/executive-order-making-open-and-machine-readable-new-default-government-) about open data. This Executive Order and accompanying [Open Data Policy](http://www.whitehouse.gov) [PDF 6MB] requires that, going forward, all data generated by the federal government be made available in ways that make the data easy to find, accessible, and usable ([read about it in this blog post](http://blog.aids.gov/2013/05/landmark-steps-to-liberate-open-data.html)).[Executive orders](http://www.archives.gov/federal-register/executive-orders/about.html) are official actions through which the President of the United States manages the operations of the federal government. This Executive Order has implications for all of us.
