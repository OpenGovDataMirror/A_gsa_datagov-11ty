In this new and pilot-stage of Climate.Data.gov, you will find resources to help companies, communities, and citizens understand and prepare for the impacts of coastal flooding and sea level rise. Over time, you’ll find more datasets, web services, and tools, as well as other themes such as the vulnerability of the food supply and the threats to human health from climate change.

Check out the [data catalog](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset?groups=climate5434&_groups_limit=0) to browse relevant datasets. If you are looking for a streamlined list, the [resources page](../climate-resources.html) features datasets and services on coastal vulnerability.

Looking for information to help you and your community plan for coastal flooding and sea level rise? Please review our list of [tools](../climate-tools.html), which will grow over time.

If you are a problem-solver or entrepreneur who wants to take on a big challenge to help communities and citizens be more aware and prepared for climate change, check out the [challenges](../climate-challenges.html).
