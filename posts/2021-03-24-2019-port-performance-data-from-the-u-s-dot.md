The U.S. Department of Transportation’s Port Performance Freight Statistics Program: Annual Reports to Congress provide summary statistics and detailed analysis for the Nation’s largest container, tonnage, and dry bulk ports. Results from calendar year 2019 are now available online.

Individual port statistics can be viewed through the “Port Profile” link on the main Port Performance website at: https://www.bts.gov/ports.

Historic reports from multiple years are available from the National Transportation Library at https://rosap.ntl.bts.gov/welcome

These are great resources for anyone interested in port activity, port performance, maritime topics, or transportation infrastructure in general.
