title: 'Data USA: Visualizing Government Data'
---

Much has been written about open government data and its contribution to developing consumer [applications](https://www.data.gov/applications) such as [Zoc Doc](https://www.zocdoc.com/) and [Spot Crime](http://www.spotcrime.com/). The data resources on Data.gov can also help researchers, policymakers, and planners make better informed decisions through the use of visualization apps. [Data USA](http://datausa.io/), an application developed by Deloitte, Datawheel, and Cesar Hidalgo, assistant professor at the MIT Media Lab, allows users to visualize open government data from the U.S. Census Bureau, Bureau of Economic Analysis, Bureau of Labor Statistics, and National Center for Education Statistics. Data USA’s visualizations can be used on economic and labor trends to develop better workforce programs, help job seekers identify the most promising cities and states for specific careers, and inform businesses on locations for growth and new opportunities. MIT Media Lab’s Hidalgo, recently [told](http://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/05/technology/datausa-government-data.html?_r=0) *The New York Times* that Data USA was devised to “transform data into stories.”
