This Grain Transportation Report: Rail Deliveries to Port dataset from the USDA provides the total number of rail carloads used in weekly grain shipments traveling to ports in five different regions of the country starting in 1994. The five regions are Atlantic, East Gulf, Mississippi River, Texas Gulf, and Pacific. In 2008 the dataset started recording cross border rail shipments in to Mexico. Included with each record is start-of-week date, end-of-week date, and number week of year (1-52). For users interested in learning about intermodal freight flows, agricultural exports, and how the marine transportation system supports American farmers this dataset is a great resource.
