![Storm tracks from the 2017 Atlantic hurricane season.](https://s3-us-gov-west-1.amazonaws.com/cg-0817d6e3-93c4-4de8-8b32-da6919464e61/2017-hurricane-season_figure-cmts-300x300.jpg)

A 2018 report from the U.S. Committee on the Marine Transportation System (CMTS) gathered recommendations and ‘lessons learned’ from the 2017 hurricane season on how to improve resiliency across the marine transportation system. The report notes that “over the course of the 2017 hurricane season, Hurricanes Harvey, Irma, and Maria affected the operating status of at least 45 ports throughout the lower continental United States and the U.S. Caribbean territories. These ports provide critical services to regional economies in the Gulf of Mexico, Southeastern coast, and the Caribbean, and were confronted with a succession of major storms that impacts a massive geographical region with unique challenges… The scale and impact of these storms strained the U.S. emergency response community and the ability of MTS agencies to preposition and prioritize recovery efforts.”

This report relied on both expert comments and data gathered before, during, and after the hurricane season. Estimates of the impacts discussed on this report utilized a variety of data sets across trade and transportation sectors. These data sets including statistics on trade patterns and commodity tonnage from previous years; records of port advisory and closure status; historic vessel position reports; and storm-related characteristics such as date, location, and wind speed.
