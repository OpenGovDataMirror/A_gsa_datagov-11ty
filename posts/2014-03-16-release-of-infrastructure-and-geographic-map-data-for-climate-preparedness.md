title: Release of Infrastructure and Geographic Map Data for Climate-Preparedness
---

To help communities and citizens plan for the risks of coastal flooding and other climate-change-related impacts, theDepartment of Homeland Security, the Department of Defense, the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, and the U.S. Geological Survey are releasing today a collection of non-sensitive datasets containing mapping information on hundreds of thousands of the Nation’s infrastructure units and geographical features, including bridges, roads, railroad tunnels, canals, and river gauges. [These data](http://hsip.geoplatform.gov/arcgis/rest/services/HSIP_Public) are being made available via user-friendly mapping services on [Geoplatform.gov](http://www.geoplatform.gov/climate-resources) and[Climate.data.gov](http://climate.data.gov).
