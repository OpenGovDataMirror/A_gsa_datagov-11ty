title: A Maritime Topic for a Maritime Nation

We are excited to launch the Maritime Topic on Data.gov, a place where the diverse datasets relevant to maritime transportation can be shared and discovered.  The marine transportation system connects people around the world, moving energy commodities, consumer goods, and agricultural products from producers to markets – and don’t forget the cruise ships that move millions of vacationers every year.  With [over 28 U.S. Federal Government departments, agencies, bureaus, and independent commissions](https://www.cmts.gov/) involved in the marine transportation system there is a wealth of existing data on topics ranging from [marine mammals](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/large-whale-incident-database) to [trust fund revenues](https://catalog.data.gov/dataset/trust-fund-financial-reports-70249).  Whatever your interest in marine transportation we hope the Maritime Topic helps point you towards the right data for your question.  Check back for updates, highlighted datasets, and examples of how maritime data is being used across the public and private sectors.
