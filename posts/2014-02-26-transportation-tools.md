The Department of Transportation and other public and private organizations provide a range of software tools useful for transportation impact analysis. Generally, software tools break down into several categories:

*   Tools for obtaining climate data (for example, FHWA’s CMIP)
*   Tools for deriving geospatial impacts of weather and extreme events (for example, NOAA’s SLOSH and FEMA’s Hazus)
*   Storm surge and sea-level rise specific products, to determine regional sea level rise and examine erosion risks
*   Tools for risk prioritization (FHWA’s VAST)
*   General purpose Geospatial Information System (GIS) tools, for manipulation of digital elevation models and mapping various climate risk

We do not recommend specific general-purpose GIS tools. There are a range of useful commercial, open source, and freeware general-purpose and specialized tools available, each with its particular features.
