Here users will find web-based tools and publicly accessible models to help understand, analyze, and assess vulnerabilities and resilience of the energy sector and critical infrastructure to climate variability, global climate change, and compounding stressors. Tools include interactive mapping applications as well as navigable libraries containing scientific and technical publications, additional datasets, or models. Please [let us know](http://www.data.gov/climate/climate-feedback/) if there are other tools that should be listed here.
