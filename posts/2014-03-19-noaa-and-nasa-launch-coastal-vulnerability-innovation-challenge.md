title: NOAA and NASA Launch Coastal Vulnerability Innovation Challenge
---

Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage from coastal inundation. We only have to remember the recent impact of Hurricane Sandy on communities in the northeast to see the potential damage that a single storm can cause. Your challenge is to create tools and provide information so communities can prepare for coastal inundation. Through the use of data, visualizations, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal inundation hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise. [This challenge](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/coastal-inundation/) is part of the International Space Apps Challenge, a[global collaboration](https://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/) to solve challenges facing humanity–both on and off Planet Earth. Join a team for the event on April 12-13, 2014! Visitthe [Resources](/climate/climate-resources) section to find datasets, web services, and tools that will help you compete in this challenge related to coastal flooding and climate change.
