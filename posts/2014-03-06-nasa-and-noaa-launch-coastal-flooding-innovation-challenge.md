Want to solve an innovation challenge to address climate change? The [International Space Apps Challenge](http://2014.spaceappschallenge.org) is an international mass collaboration offering four climate-related challenges, including…

[**Coastal Inundation in Your Community**](http://2014.spaceappschallenge.org/challenge/coastal-inundation/)

Coastal communities are becoming increasingly vulnerable to the risk of damage and danger from flooding. Your challenge is to create tools and provide information so communities can prepare for coastal inundation. Through the use of data, visualizations, citizen engagement, and simulations, you can help people understand their exposure to coastal inundation hazards and their increased vulnerability due to population increase and sea level rise.

Space Apps is a two-day event (April 12-13, 2014) that has about 40 challenges organized around Earth and space themes. Teams of technologists, scientists, designers, artists, educators entrepreneurs, developers and students across the globe collaborate and engage with publicly available data to design innovative solutions for global challenges. Visit the [resources](https://www.data.gov/climate/climate-resources) tab to find datasets, web services, and tools that will help you compete in the Space Apps Challenge on the coastal impacts of climate change.
